# Data Visualization
------
I am quite excited about this unit, for there is no question that data is one of the most powerful tools in today’s society. What is even more captivating is the variety of ways that we can aesthetically express data. While many may associate data with mundane statistics and numbers, the visual illustration of these findings have the capacity to tell a story and construct a meaningful narrative. Researching different kinds of data visualization introduced me to many novel, creative ideas I had yet to consider in regard to interactive graphics. 

After reading a book called Linked: "How Everything Is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life," I became very interested in understanding how networks form and prosper. I found this piece by Evelina Gabasova which captures that very concept in outlining the social networks from the six Star Wars movies. Her analysis derived from considering that two characters were connected if they spoke in the same scene. As someone who grew up avidly watching Star Wars, I found Gabasova’s piece quite thought-provoking and appreciated the effort she put into understanding the complexities of character interactions. In a series as complex as Star Wars, defining main characters is no simple feat, as the plot is not exactly straightforward. Breaking down relationships through visually expressing data is a concept I would love to pursue on my own moving forward.

Furthermore, I found the below human migration chart created by Ann Jackson to be an extremely fascinating form of data visualization. The visual strives to depict the movement of the 244 million international migrants in 2015. Each chord is representative of the number of migrants from an area to a destination, with chords ranked by largest number overall at the left. The text below then depicts the largest receiving nations. Because I have spent a substantial portion of my studies researching immigration, I find Jackson’s visualization to be quite inspiring. Being published by the United Nations, this piece evidently is capable of telling a meaningful story, which quite possible could impact how policymakers conceive issues in migration.
